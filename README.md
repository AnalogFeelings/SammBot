The official website for the Samm-Bot project. It is written entirely from scratch in plain HTML5, JavaScript and CSS.

> Currently, this website is unfinished and **very** unpolished.

## :trophy: Maintainers

This is a list of all the people who maintain Samm-Bot's development.

## :package: Serving

You simply need to start an HTTP server from the website's root and access it through localhost on your chosen port.  
`python -m http.server` is an easy way to do so if you have python installed.
