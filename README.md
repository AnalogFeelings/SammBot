Samm-Bot is a free and open-source Discord bot that I began developing around 2020 for fun.  
Its source code was private, was written in TypeScript, and was very feature-lacking.

In 2021, I decided to rewrite it in .NET, make it open-source and much more feature rich. Nowadays, it focuses on being useful, with features such as moderation and fun commands.

My main motivation is because currently, most large bots are owned by money-hungry people who like to shove Premium ads everywhere they can.  
I wanted to make a free and open-source bot that people could rely on for simple server-keeping tasks such as warnings, logging and more.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Currently, the bot is in a **beta** state and is very unpolished.

## :trophy: Maintainers

* :gear: **Server Settings Module**: Allows you to set server-specific settings, like logging, welcome messages, etc...
* :judge: **Moderation Module**: Allows you to kick, ban, mute, or bulk delete messages.

## :package: Building

The .NET toolset will automatically pull all the required NuGet packages on build.  
Samm-Bot has currently been tested on **x86-64** and **aarch64**.

For Linux and macOS users, this [tiny script](./Scripts/BuildSamm.sh) should make it easier for you to pull and build automatically.

> [!NOTE]  
> The script linked above requires Bash.

## :cd: Database Setup

Here is a small TL;DR on how to update the database in Samm-Bot.  
Knowing how EntityFramework works is still recommended for this project.

### :eight_spoked_asterisk: Creating Migrations
Grab the command line, cd to the SammBot.Bot folder, and execute this command:

```
dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>
```

This will let you modify the structure of the database's tables.

### :white_check_mark: Applying Migrations
Grab the command line, cd to the SammBot.Bot folder, and execute this command:

```
dotnet ef database update
```

This will apply the latest migration to the local database, or create a database if one doesn't already exist.

## :judge: Code Style Guidelines

Please read the [style guidelines](STYLE_GUIDELINES.md) before creating a pull request.  
Your pull request won't be merged until the code is up to the standards.

Adding an automatic `.editorconfig` file to enforce these is of low priority right now, so please read the file thoroughly.
